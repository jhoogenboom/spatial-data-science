# Assignments

## Overview

There are 3 graded assignments in the course. These will assess the programming and reasoning skills developed in the weeks before the assignment submissions. The contents of the assignments will be released according to the [schedule](../introduction/schedule.md).

* [Assignment 01](../assignments/assignment-01.ipynb) - Data Collection and Wrangling (15%)
* [Assignment 02](../assignments/assignment-02.ipynb) - Geographic Visualisation (15%)
* [Assignment 03](../assignments/assignment-03.ipynb) - Prediction/Inference (20%)

### Marking Criteria for assignments

The following rubric will be used for assessments. See the column with points (2) for what is expected of an ideal assignment. Points will be deducted if elements are missing and/or incorrectly done:
