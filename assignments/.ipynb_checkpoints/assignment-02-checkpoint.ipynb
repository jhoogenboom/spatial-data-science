The guide can be found [here](https://trivikverma.github.io/spatial-data-science/resources_index.html#a-guide-to-critical-data-science).

    "`Problem Statement`: \n",
    "- For this assignment you will use the SHRUG (Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic) Platform for India to formulate a hypothesis/RQ and conduct an exploratory data analysis. \n",
    "- To formulate the hypothesis, provide at least `two measurements` that may be related to each other (for example: your hypothesis is that areas with `high air pollution` also have relative high `night light pollution`). And explain why? For example, higher night lights pollution entails densification and nighttime activity. This is possible when many people are clustered together for exchnage of goods and services in a city, ultimately leading to more pollution due to use of resources, traffic and mobility, use of water, discharge of pollutants from cars and factories, etc. \n",
    "- Be explicit about how you define these measurements using markdown cells (for example: how do you measure the air pollution, and how do you measure the levels of light pollution during the night?). Do you use variables to proxy any of these effects?\n",
    "- Observe that the measurements have a normative value attached to it (for example: according to your hypothesis, `high levels` of air pollution in an area is of `more` interest). Please do not assume that there is only one normative definition of a certain measurement and skip your reasoning.\n",
    "- On the basis of the hypothesis and its associated measurements, you will conduct some exploratory/spatial data analysis and provide a reflection of how your hypothesis manifests spatially, using maps and other aiding plots. \n",

    "_Note:_ I am not looking for mathematical equations as justification, but you are welcome to also form simple relations and show them in markdown. \n",

    "\n",
    "> I hypothesise that district in India with relatively high air pollution also have high levels of light pollution, due to high levels of [economic activity](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2019/09/satellite-images-at-night-and-economic-growth-yao).\n",
    "\n",
    ">Definitions of metrics:\n",
    ">- I will measure these effects at district level for all variables.\n",
    ">- Surface PM2.5 pollution (estimated annual ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5))\n",
    ">- Night time lights (night time luminosity)\n",
    ">- Facebook relative wealth index (measured as an index between 0 and 1). The index is determined by a machine-learning model that collects target variables from traditional survey data spatially linked to features constructed from non-traditional data like high-resolution satellite imagery, data from mobile phone networks, and topographic maps, as well as aggregated and deidentified connectivity data from Facebook. Used in this analysis as a proxy for wealth and economic activity. This is arguably an oversimplification of the concept of inequality but is considered a suitable approximation given the available datasets."

    "    - Explain what your dependent variable is. Explain your choice of independent variables.\n",
    "    - Would you wish to include any variables that are not available? How is the inclusion beneficial for the hypothesis? Are there any variables (proxies) present with which you could replace these missing values?\n",
    "    - Would that have an effect on your outcomes? Think about bias in the data. Explain your reasoning.\n",
    "    - Reflect on any cases in which this hypothesis will be rejected? Why?\n",
    "    - Reflect on cases in which the hypothesis will be falsely rejected or falsely accepted? Think about bias in the data and in your own reasoning.\n",
    "    - Reflect if there are any important perspectives that you are not taking into account by choosing this hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Carry out an exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "5. Report on your hypothesis results both in relationships of the variables and spatial manifestation of the outcome. \n",
