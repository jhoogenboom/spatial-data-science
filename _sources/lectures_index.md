*A GUIDE TO FOLLOW THIS PAGE*

- The slides will be updated latest a night before the lecture in **pdf** format.
- Lectures will not be recorded or delivered online.
- The section **To do before class** provides content that is useful for following the lectures. I expect you to follow it before every lecture. It will take about 1 hour of prep at home.
- Section **Extra Material** is exactly extra. It is **not required** for this course but can prove really helpful for gaining extra knowledge either during or after this course. Sometimes I use it to build the contents of the lecture and at others I find them helpful in my research related to the weekly topics but I will never question your knowledge on that.

# Let's begin

Before starting the course, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jqEj8XUPlk&t=80s) by Khalid Kadir about a reflection on poverty (an example of a social problem), expertise and equity. This representation is an example of how experts create boxes around their craft. As a data scientist or a future expert (consultant, data analyst, policymaker, etc.), it is our responsibility to step out of those boxes and engage with communities to strive for just outcomes. If you have seen this video, send me a meme about poverty, inequality and data. The best submission will win a prize at the end of the course.

## Lecture 9 - Machine Learning for Everyone

You may want to buy [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](https://leanpub.com/theMLbook) as _some_ chapters will be used in _some_ topics from this point onwards and it is generally a fantastic book to have. If you cannot or do not want to spend $20.00 on the e-copy, email me, and we will figure something out. The author has invested a lot in writing this book, and it is an excellent resource on Machine Learning, even beyond this class.
