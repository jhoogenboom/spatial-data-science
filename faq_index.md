# FAQ

## Late Assignments
If for some reason you are not able to hand in the assignment on time, please email me in advance explaining your situation, so we can work it out. I am fully open to exploring options for late submissions, as long as I get a propoer explanation from you, followed by a discussion of what is possible in your situation. If this process is not followed, I will not accept late submissions.

## Assignment Format
All assessments will be handed in via **Brightspace** (*no emails with submissions, please*) so we can facilitate summative (graded) feedback for you. If something is not clear, ask me on one of the communication channels set up for the course.

## Email
I normally respond to emails within a day during a course period. If there is a delay of over _72_ hours, please send a reminder. It is not your responsibility to remind me, but it may be that the email went to spam or did not reach me. Do not expect us to respond to last-minute emails before assignments are due. Most questions should be saved for lab hours with either the TAs or me.

## Microsoft Teams
Please **do not call/text** us on Teams out of the blue. Sticking to class hours helps us make sure you get all the relevant help. Email works best for questions/thoughts/comments/feedback.

## Academic Honesty
This course is designed to understand the use of data science in addressing urban problems. Many of your ideas may dwell from the same spirit that brought you to this program in the first place: helping society transform from inequalities to justice. While I encourage study groups and working together to understand course material, all assignment related work should be your own. Please do not use other studentsâ€™ work for your assignments. As these are strongly about programming and visuals, it may be that a lot of your outputs are the same. However, if they are copied, I will know.

For project-related work and discussions, we will be working in groups. If you cite an author or use their ideas,
please cite properly. Plagiarised assignments will receive a failing mark. More information on what
constitutes as plagiarism is available from the [TU Delft Rules and Guidelines of the Board of Examiners](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/tpm-student-portal/education/rules-and-guidelines). If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask me.

## Grade Disputes
Students who wish to dispute grades on an assignment must do so in writing. Grade disputes
must be submitted no sooner than 24 hours after receiving your grade but within two weeks.
Any dispute should specifically outline why you feel there is an error and should not contain
information about what grades you usually get or how long you spent on the assignment.

If you are not satisfied, and you wish to discuss your grade further, you have two options:

[A]: If you are interested in what/how about your assignment/project answers, and wish to learn how to improve your work, we can have a discussion about it. Please request a 15 minutes appointment by email. We will **not** discuss changing the grading of your answers during this discussion.

[B]: In the case that you are not satisfied with your grade, and believe that you deserve more, we will follow the procedure below. Per TBM rules, I am not allowed to change the grade when you are present, in order to prevent any kind of bias. Therefore:
- [x] You need to prepare a written document, arguing per question or criterion why your answers/report should get a different number of points than what you have received.
- [x] I will consider your argumentation and re-grade the entire assignment/project. This means that you will receive a new, and this time final grade, which may be higher but also lower than the previous score. I will communicate this grade with you by email.

## Electronic Technology Policy
You can use whatever gadgets you want to. I will try my best to compete with Social Media for your attention.

## Accommodating Students with Special Needs and Disabilities
We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students. If you have any needs that might not be recognised by others generally, please do not hesitate to talk to me about it. We can figure out what might be possible for you so appropriate accommodations can be made. If an unexpected personal or medical challenge is interfering with your ability to complete assignments and/or the final project, it is your responsibility to contact me as early as possible. I will work with you to address it as best as possible for you.
