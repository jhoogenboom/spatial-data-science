# Lectures

*A GUIDE TO FOLLOW THIS PAGE :*

- The slides will be updated latest a night before the lecture in **pdf** format.
- Lectures will not be recorded or delivered online.
- The section **To do before class** provides content that is useful for following the lectures. I expect you to follow it before every lecture. It will take about 1 hour of prep.
- Section **Extra Material** is exactly that. It is **not required** for this course but can prove really helpful for gaining extra knowledge either during or after this course. Sometimes I use it to build the contents of the lecture and at others I find them helpful in my research related to the weekly topics but I will never question your knowledge on that.

# Let's begin

Before starting this course, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jqEj8XUPlk&t=80s) by Khalid Kadir about a reflection on poverty (an example of a social problem), expertise and equity. This representation is an example of how experts create boxes around their craft. As a data scientist or a future expert (consultant, data analyst, policymaker, etc.), it is our responsibility to step out of those boxes and engage with communities to strive for just outcomes.
